# Delayer

## Description
Delayer is a simple Arduino library for implementing precise, non-blocking delays using the `millis()` function. It helps avoid `delay()` and supports multitasking-like timing.

## Features
- Non-blocking delays
- Based on `millis()`
- Easy to integrate
- Works on any Arduino-compatible board

## Installation
Use the Arduino Library Manager or clone/download this repository into your `libraries` folder.
